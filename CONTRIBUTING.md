## Code of Conduct

Help us keep OSRS Logs open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Got a question or problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

## Found a bug?

If you find a bug in the soure code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](###submitting-an-issue) to our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/osrslogs/osrs-hiscores). Even better, you can [submit a pull request](###submitting-a-pull-request) with a fix.

## Coding rules

### Commit message convention

We follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:

| Type       | Description                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `chore`    | Tooling change                            |
| `docs`     | Documentation change only                 |
| `feat`     | A new feature                             |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                 |
| `refactor` | Code refactor                             |
| `revert`   | Reverting a previous commit               |
| `style`    | Change that do not affect meaning of code |
| `test`     | Adding or updating test                   |

Our pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.

### Linting and tests

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org) with
[Prettier](https://prettier.io) for linting and formatting the code, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for testing.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter pass when committing.

## Working with the code

3. Navigate to the cloned directory.

```

4. Assign the original repository as a new remote

## Submission guidelines

### Submitting an issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

You can file new issues by selecting from our [new issue templates](https://github.com/osrslogs/osrs-hiscores/issues/new/choose) and filling out the issue template.

### Submitting a pull request

1. [Setup the workspace](###setup-the-workspace)
2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream and update dependencies:

```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull upstream master
$ rm -rf node_modules
$ npm install
```

3. Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change or fix:

```
$ git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
```

4. Make your changes, including appropriate test cases, following our [coding rules](##coding-rules).
5. Commit your changes, following our [commit message convention](###commit-message-convention).

```
$ git commit -a
```

Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

6. Push your topic branch to GitHub:

```bash
$ git push origin <topic-branch-name>
```

7. [Open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) with clear title and description.
